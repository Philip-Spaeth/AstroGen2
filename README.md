## Introduction
Astro Genesis 2.0 is a powerful tool for astronomers, astrophysicists, and hobbyists interested in exploring the mysteries of the universe. The software simulates the gravitational interactions between a large number of particles, representing stars, gas clouds, dark matter, and other celestial bodies, using an advanced octree algorithm. This approach allows for efficient and scalable simulations, even for massive datasets.

## Features
- **Advanced n-body Simulation**: Simulate complex gravitational interactions with high precision.
- **Octree Data Structure**: Efficiently manage spatial data for large-scale simulations.
- **Dark Energy and Dark Matter Modeling**: Incorporate the effects of dark energy and dark matter into your simulations.
- **Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)**: Model fluid-like behavior of interstellar gas and other particles.
- **Dual Engine Architecture**: Separate Simulation and Render engines for optimized performance.
- **Video Rendering**: Render high-quality videos of your simulations.
- **Live Viewer**: Interactively explore simulations in real-time.
- **C++ Core**: High performance and flexibility.
