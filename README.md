See the GetttingStarted.md file for further information. 
  
## Usage
## Simulation
The Simulation Engine is responsible for calculating the n-body interactions. It uses an octree structure to optimize the computation of gravitational forces, making it possible to simulate millions of particles efficiently.

## Render Engine
The Render Engine can generate high-quality video outputs from simulation data or provide a live viewer mode for real-time exploration. The rendering process incorporates advanced techniques to visualize the complex interactions between particles, including the influence of dark matter and dark energy.
